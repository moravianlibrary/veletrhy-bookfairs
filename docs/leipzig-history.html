				<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-black align-right display-4">The international Leipzig Book Fair is undoubtedly one of the most important book festivals and has one of the most significant literary cultures in the world. During the four-day festival, more than two hundred and fifty thousand visitors enter the gates of the fair’s premises. In comparison, this is about six times more than the visitors who come annually to Book World Prague. A series of meetings with authors, discussion forums, book presentations and accompanying exhibitions are prepared for them. A substantive part of the fair takes place during the first day, when the “Leipzig Reads” (Leipzig liest) festival starts.
<br>Visiting the fair in Leipzig is a must, not only for serious and respectable European publishers, but also for national states that want to gain more visibility at the fair. In fact, Leipzig is a key player in the book market in Germany. Due to this, talks regarding the guest of honour at the fair were started by the Czech Republic three years ago and turned out well. The Czech Republic will be the focus country of the fair next year, in March 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

				<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-black align-right display-4">The Moravian Library in Brno is in charge of preparing Czech authors and Czech literary cultural presentations. The preparations have been coordinated by a dramaturgy council for two years. There, leading experts, who focus on Czech literature, culture and the presentation abroad on various levels, debate about the future Czech programme and its form.
<br>This year’s book fair in Leipzig is to open on Thursday, March 15th, and will last until Sunday, the 18th March. On its very first day, the fair’s long-time director, Oliver Zille, will ceremoniously announce the Czech Republic as the guest of honour for the year 2019. At a press conference, attended by the Minister of Culture of the Czech Republic, Ilja Šmíd, Mr. Zille and prominent representatives of the city of Leipzig, the state of Saxony and the Czech Republic will announce the programme of the Czech Year. It will include the presentation within the fair’s week in 2019, and also feature contemporary Czech culture in the German-speaking region throughout the whole year, from October 2018 to November 2019. Dozens of cultural institutions from the Czech Republic, Germany, Switzerland and Austria are involved in the Czech Year project, not only in Saxon Leipzig, but also in the whole German-speaking region. Czech writers, literary culture, thinking, art, comics, music, design and photography will be introduced during these fourteen months. Similarly, audiences in Prague, Brno and other cities in the Czech Republic will get an opportunity to enjoy contemporary German literary forms and topics.
<br>The aim of the Czech Year project is to intensify Czech and German cultural contact and, in general, to increase awareness between the two countries with such a close history, language and geography. That is why many programmes of the Czech Year are designed to become permanent parts of the Czech and German cultural exchange.
<br>Some samples and illustrations will be offered to German audiences in this year’s fair. There will be author’s readings, and discussions with prominent figures of contemporary Czech prose, poetry and drama. <strong>Michal Ajvaz, Bianca Bellová, Petr Borkovec, David Drábek, Sylva Fischerová, Arnošt Goldflam, Jiří Hájíček and Petr Hruška</strong> will introduce their contemporary works, and the current form of the Czech literature and literary life.
<br>The increased intensity of promoting Czech literature in connection with the Czech Year has already had positive effects in the German-speaking region. This is proven by the quantity of applications for the support of Czech book translations to German this year. While in the past, there used to be three or four applications on a regular basis, this year there were more than thirty in the first round.&nbsp;<br></p>

				<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-black align-right display-4">From mid-March onwards, those fancying and participating in the literary sector will have, once again, the opportunity of visiting international book fairs to explore, in one place, contemporary book culture – whether presented by countries or publishing houses. This year, too, the imaginary year of fairs starts in Leipzig. After Frankfurt, Leipzig is the site most important event of a similar nature in the German language region – one strongly oriented toward reading activities and cultural debate.
<br><br>This fair will be officially launched on 22 March 2017. The festivals named Leipzig liest (Leipzig Reads) and Manga Comic-con are part of this event as usually.<br>
<br>As well, if you already visited the Czech national exhibit in the past, finding the same spot in Hall 4 as in the previous years will be everything what you will need to do! Arranged for by the Czech Ministry of Culture and prepared by Moravian Library to a brand new design referring to the Czech functionalist architecture, the area will present a selection from the current book production – particularly masterpieces awarded in literary sector last year, as well as articles of specific Czech publishers which have been significantly influencing the form of Czech culture. The clue given above definitely leads to publishing houses such as Baobab, Academia and Host.&nbsp;<br></p>

				<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-black align-right display-4">The basis of the books presented consists of titles that have attracted the attention of professional and reader community, though, meaning that collections that reflect the present form of taste of the Czech reader, as the Czech literary prizes shape it, will be the highlight. Visitors to the exhibit can learn more about the books written by winners of major local awards, whether it is the National Prize, Jaroslav Seifert Prize, Magnesia Litera, Jiří Orten Prize or Josef Škvorecký Prize. These will be accompanied by award-winning publications from book collections such as Zlatá stuha (Gold Ribbon) or Nejkrásnější české knihy (Most Beautiful Czech Books). The Czech exhibit will in no case lack a selection from the latest Czech books or translations from Czech literature. The showcase of translated titles will also show the areas of interest through which the audience abroad “reads” our country, so to speak.<br>
<br><strong>The Czech national exhibit was formally opened on 23 March by Daniel Herman, the Minister of Culture of the Czech Republic, Oliver Zill, Director of the Leipzig fair, Burkhard Jung, the Lord Mayor of Leipzig, and Tomáš Podivínský, the Czech Ambassador to Germany.&nbsp;</strong><br></p>

				<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-black align-right display-4">In the early evening of the same day, the act was followed by another ceremony involving the signing of a memorandum which will make the Czech Republic the chief country for the 2019 Leipzig Book Fair.<br>
<br>On the very same day, the cultural agenda became complete with sessions involving reading from newly published Gruša essays and presenting the German translation of Durych’s Creeping through Germany (Czech: Plížení Německem), in addition to the events mentioned above. Sessions where books were being read by authors in person as well as discussions mostly took place at the weekend, when four Czech authors introduced themselves one by one, representing the divergent directions of contemporary literature: The national exhibit as well as the surrounding cultural forums witnessed Tomáš Šebek, Viktoria Hanišová, Iva Pekárková and Jan Novák as speakers.<br>
<br>While Tomáš Šebek presented his experience with Doctors without Borders, featuring himself as a man of records rather than a man of letters, Jan Novák covered Mašín brothers and Miloš Forman, Iva Pekárková was bringing her long years spent in New York and London into spotlight, and Viktoria Hanišová presented her first-fruit novel, Agnes (CZ: Anežka), describing the relationship of mother with her adoptive daughter.&nbsp;<br></p>
